## What are DKIM, SPF, and DMARC?

### üîë **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**
- **Purpose**: Uses cryptographic signatures to verify email authenticity
- **How it works**: The sending server adds a digital signature to the email. Receiving servers verify this signature using the sender's public key stored in DNS
- **Benefits**: Prevents email tampering and spoofing
- **Example**: `DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; d=example.com; s=selector;...`

### üõ°Ô∏è **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**
- **Purpose**: Prevents email spoofing by specifying authorised sending servers
- **How it works**: Domain owners publish a list of authorised IP addresses in DNS. Receiving servers check if the sending IP is in this list
- **Benefits**: Stops unauthorised servers from sending emails on behalf of your domain
- **Example**: `Received-SPF: pass (google.com: domain designates 192.168.1.1 as permitted sender)`

### ‚úÖ **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance)**
- **Purpose**: Combines SPF and DKIM to provide comprehensive email authentication policy
- **How it works**: Tells receiving servers what to do with emails that fail SPF and DKIM checks (reject, quarantine, or accept)
- **Benefits**: Provides reporting and policy enforcement for email authentication
- **Example**: `Authentication-Results: mx.google.com; dmarc=pass header.from=example.com;`
